<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
  My name is Muhammad Nabeel, and I am currently residing in the Punjab province of Pakistan. 
  I have recently started my A Levels in education. In my O Levels, I achieved an impressive 
  result of 6 A/A*s and 3 Bs.

<p>
  Aside from studying, I have taken on leadership roles both in school and in various competitions. 
  I was the Head Boy at my current school, as well as at my previous school. I was selected for this
  role by the majority of the students, after achieving a perfect score in my interview with the head
  of my school, Ms. Buahra
</p>

<p> 
  I have also participated in several out-of-school competitions, where I often took on the role of 
  leader. This proved to be quite effective, as my team and I were able to compile and prepare all the 
  materials and presentations on time. Even when faced with obstacles, we adapted and overcame them, 
  achieving success. We won several events, competing against some of the best schools in the country, 
  and even won an entire competition once

  In my personal time, I enjoy playing competitive video games with my friends. I also love trying a 
  variety of foods and consider myself a foodieâ€”though, if I don't like something, I have a strong 
  reaction to it. Aside from my hobbies, I am very family-oriented and am dedicated to providing the 
  best future I can for my family.

<p>
  Above all, I am a devout Muslim who believes in one God, Allah. This might come as a surprise to some,
  but my faith helps me bring out the best in myself and stay calm under challenging situations. As we 
  are taught to do our best and trust that Allah will take care of the rest.
